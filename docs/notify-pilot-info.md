### The Public Benefits Studio

The Public Benefits Studio is a team inside of GSA’s Technology
Transformation Services (TTS), home to innovative programs like 18F and
Login.gov. We collaborate **with benefits programs to develop shared
technology tools and best practices that reduce the burden of navigating
government programs for low income individuals and families.**  


We’re a cross-functional team of technologists with specialized
experience working across public benefits programs like Medicaid, SNAP,
and unemployment insurance.

**U.S. Notify** will be a federally-run shared service allowing staff to
send thousands of customized-to-the-user text messages per year at
little-to-no-cost. The easy interface requires no technical expertise to
use and the setup process takes only ten minutes.

### WHERE WE’RE AT

**We’re in the early stages of assessing this product’s market fit and
targeting to pilot** this shared service with at least 3 partners in
spring of 2023. Following our first pilot, we intend to scale by adding
additional features based on partner needs.
