    eventlet works by monkey-patching core IO libraries (such as ssl) to be non-blocking. However, there's currently
    a bug: In the normal socket library it may throw a timeout error as a `socket.timeout` exception. However
    eventlet.green.ssl's patch raises an ssl.SSLError('timed out',) instead. redispy handles socket.timeout but not
    ssl.SSLError, so we solve this by monkey patching the monkey patching code to raise the correct exception type
