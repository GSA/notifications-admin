    A SerialisedModel takes a dictionary, typically created by
    serialising a database object. It then takes the value of specified
    keys from the dictionary and adds them to itself as properties, so
    that it can be interacted with like any other object. It is cleaner
    and safer than dealing with dictionaries directly because it
    guarantees that:
    - all of the ALLOWED_PROPERTIES are present in the underlying
      dictionary
    - any other abritrary properties of the underlying dictionary canâ€™t
      be accessed

    If you are adding a new field to a model, you should ensure that
    all sources of the cache data are updated to return that new field,
    then clear the cache, before adding that field to the
    ALLOWED_PROPERTIES list.
