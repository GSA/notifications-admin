    <!-- <p>
      If you use Notify.gov to send text messages, you may need to send us a <a class="usa-link" href="#purchase-orders">purchase order</a>.
    </p>

      Invoices
    </h2>

    <p>
      Notify is run by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Cabinet Office will send your organization an invoice each quarter if you:
    </p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>exceed the <a class="usa-link" href="{{ url_for('.pricing') }}">free text message allowance</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your organization has more than one Notify service, you’ll see a breakdown of each service on your invoice.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the value of an invoice is less than £250 (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>), it will be added to the total for the next quarter to save time and effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can pay by BACS, debit card, or credit card.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please start your payment reference with the invoice number.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-body-lg" id="purchase-orders">
      Purchase orders
    </h2>

    <p>
      If your organization’s total estimated spend is more than £500 per quarter (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>), you need to raise a purchase order (PO).
    </p>

    <p>
      Your organization should raise a single <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr> for the estimated cost of all its services. You can update the <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr> any time if your usage increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your organization may need to <a class="usa-link" href="#">add the Cabinet Office as a supplier</a> before you can raise a <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr>.
