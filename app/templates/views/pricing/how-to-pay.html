      If you use US Notify to send text messages or letters, you may need to send us a <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#purchase-orders">purchase order</a>.

      Notify is run by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Cabinet Office will send your organisation an invoice each quarter if you:
    </p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>exceed the <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('.pricing') }}">free text message allowance</a></li>
      <li>send letters</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If your organisation has more than one Notify service, you’ll see a breakdown of each service on your invoice.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If the value of an invoice is less than £250 (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>), it will be added to the total for the next quarter to save time and effort.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can pay by BACS, debit card, or credit card.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Please start your payment reference with the invoice number.

      If your organisation’s total estimated spend is more than £500 per quarter (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>), you need to raise a purchase order (PO).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your organisation should raise a single <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr> for the estimated cost of all its services. You can update the <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr> any time if your usage increases.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your organisation may need to <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.billing_details') }}">add the Cabinet Office as a supplier</a> before you can raise a <abbr title="purchase order">PO</abbr>.
