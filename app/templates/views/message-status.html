  <p>Notify’s real-time dashboard lets you check the status of any message.</p>
  <p>For <a class="usa-link" href="{{ url_for('main.security') }}">security</a>, this information is only available for seven days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.</p>
  <p>This page describes the statuses you'll see when you're signed in to Notify.</p>

  <!-- <p>If you’re using the Notify API, read our <a class="usa-link" href="{{ url_for('.documentation') }}">documentation</a> for a list of API statuses.<p>

  <h3 id="spam" class="heading-small">Spam</h3>
  <p>If an email is marked as spam, Notify receives a ‘complaint’ from the email provider. We’ll contact you if we receive a complaint about any of your emails. When this happens you should remove the recipient’s email address from your list.</p>

  <h3 id="open-rates" class="heading-small">Open rates and click-throughs</h3>
  <p>Notify cannot tell you if your users open an email or click on the links in an email. We do not track open rates and click-throughs because there are privacy issues. Tracking emails without asking permission from users could breach General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p> -->
