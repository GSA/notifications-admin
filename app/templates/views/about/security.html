  <p class="font-sans-lg text-base">Notify.gov is built for the needs of government agencies with fundamental system
    security processes in place to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>protect user data</li>
    <li>keep systems secure</li>
    <li>manage risks around information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Notify.gov operates under a full three-year <a href="https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-ato/"
      target="_blank">Authority-to-Operate (ATO)</a>. This federal security authorization process leverages security
    controls provided by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
  </p>

  <p>
    Our infrastructure runs on <a href="https://www.cloud.gov/" target="_blank">cloud.gov</a> and utilizes several
    services through Amazon Web
    Services (AWS), including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank"> AWS SNS </a> for sending SMS
    messages.
  </p>
  <p>For more information about the Notify.gov infrastructure, contact us at <a
      href="mailto:notify-support@gsa.gov">notify-support@gsa.gov</a>.</p>
  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    On Notify.gov, data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. To send a message, agencies upload a spreadsheet of
    phone numbers and other necessary data from their existing data management system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notify.gov is not a system of record, so it does not have a System of Records Notice (SORN). Agencies are
    responsible for managing their data outside of Notify.gov.
  </p>
  <h3>Data retention</h3>
  <p>
    Any data uploads that have recipient data are held for seven calendar days; personally identifiable information
    (PII) is never stored in Notifyâ€™s database.
  </p>
  <h2>Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    Notify.gov uses <a href="https://login.gov/what-is-login/" target="_blank">Login.gov</a> for enhanced security.
    Login.gov is an extra layer of security created by the government that uses multi-factor authentication and stronger
    passwords to protect your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    To access Notify.gov, users will use a Login.gov account associated with their agency (.gov) email with one of the
    <a href="https://login.gov/help/get-started/authentication-methods/" target="_blank">multi-factor authentication
      methods</a> offered through Login.gov.
