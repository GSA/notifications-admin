  <p>Notify.gov is a text messaging service built by and for the government. We help agencies communicate more
    effectively with the people they serve. With Notify.gov, federal and federally-funded programs can send customized
    text messages that make it possible to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meet people where they are</li>
    <li>More effectively deliver program outcomes</li>
    <li>Save administrative costs</li>
    <li>Implement <a href="https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/"
        target="_blank">21st Century IDEA</a> and other directives</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notify.gov is an easy-to-use, web-based platform. It requires no technical expertise or system integration — users
    can create an account and get started within minutes. We take the security and privacy of messaging data seriously
    by minimizing data retention and using modern encryption methods.</p>
