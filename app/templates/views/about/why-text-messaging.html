  <h2>Reach people using a common method</h2>
  <p>
    Confusing or <a
      href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/tougher-returned-mail-policies-add-to-medicaid-enrollment-drop/"
      target="_blank">unreceived notifications</a> are one of the largest barriers to people getting and keeping
    benefits. The typical ways the government communicates with people often fall short. Low income households are more
    likely to experience housing instability, which means paper mail, already slow, can easily be missed.
  </p>

      target="_blank">Pew Research shows that nearly all adults in the US have a cell phone.</a> Reliance on smartphones
    for online access is especially common among Americans with lower household incomes and those with lower levels of
    formal education. Of those earning less than $30,000 a year, 28% say their mobile phone is the sole method to
    digitally connect.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that for many people who rely on government services, cell phones may be the most reliable place to meet
    people where they already are.

  <h2>Improve customer experience</h2>
  <p>
    Text messages can deliver concise information and drive an audience to take action quickly. Timely reminders sent
    via text message have been proven to decrease re-enrollment churn and save money for administering agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Texting not only helps programs reach people using a nearly-universal communication method, it is a cost effective
    way to do so. With Notify.gov <a href="#" target="_blank">you can get started for free</a>, allowing you to try out
    texting to complement your existing communications and outreach strategies.
