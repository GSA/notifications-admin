  <h1>Write texts that provoke action</h1>
  <p class="font-sans-lg text-base"> Help your audience know what to do with the information you send.</p>

  <p>
    When writing a text, focus on the person who is going to receive the message and write it for them. Use plain
    language
    and provide easy to understand next steps.
  </p>

  <p>When deciding what types of messages to draft for your campaign, think through the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What do you want recipients to do when they receive the text?</li>
    <li>What will happen if a recipient doesn't take the action you want them to take?</li>
    <li>Will you send any follow-up texts depending on if the action was taken or not?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Be clear and concise</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use simple, everyday language. Keep the text short and clear. Stay under 300 characters.</li>
    <li>
      Say only one important thing per message. Focus on the most essential instructions and information. If there are
      multiple actions you want someone to take, consider sending a series of well-timed messages.
    </li>
    <li>Use a neutral, direct, and professional tone. This works better than a friendly or overly casual tone.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Build conditions for action</h2>
  <ol>

  </ol>

  <p>For example, getting a person to update their mailing address:</p>
  <ul class="usa-card-group flex-1 flex-wrap padding-top-2 guidance-flex-container">
    <li class="flex-1 width-full height-full padding-bottom-2">
      <div class="usa-card__container border-0">
        <ol class="guidance-list">
          <li>Clearly state the information and the response you want the recipient to take.</li>
          <li>Point directly to where the action can be completed, not to more information.</li>
          <li>Make sure the action can be completed via mobile phone, like calling a person or going to a mobile-friendly URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include at least two options for a recipient to take action. Some recipients may be more comfortable talking
            directly
            to a person, while others may prefer a web-based experience.
          </li>
          <li>Consider clearly explaining any consequences if the desired action is not completed.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="usa-card flex-1 usa-card--media-right width-full">
      <div class="usa-card__container border-0 width-full">
        <img class="width-full" src="{{ asset_url('images/phone_grey.svg') }}" role="img" alt="Phone" />
        <div class="position-absolute flex text-cener padding-5 padding-top-9">
          <p class="text-center">Write an introductory text before you start sending messages:</p>
          <p class="sms-message-wrapper text-center">{{circle_number(1) }}State Medicare Agency: Hello, MEDICARE has attempted to
            send you an update about your claim, but the mail was returned. {{circle_number(2) }}Please go to
            https://www.medicare.gov/account/login?utm_source=TEXT, {{circle_number(3) }}log in to your account, and click “My

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What provoking action looks like</h2>
  <p>Feeling a sense of ownership can influence behavior.<br>
    Example – <b>Don't miss this chance to get free internet</b> or $30 per month off your internet bill.</p>

  <p>Individuals are strongly influenced by others’ behaviors.<br>Example – <b>Thousands of residents</b> already get an
    average of $113/month in money for food.</p>

  <p>Individuals perceive losses more powerfully than gains.<br>Example – Contact us for potentially unclaimed free
    internet services <b>that belong to you</b>.</p>
