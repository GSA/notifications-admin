  <h1>Measuring performance with benchmarking</h1>
  <p class="font-sans-lg text-base">Learn how effective your texting program can be.</p>

  <p>
    Several factors determine a messaging campaign’s success, but the performance of previous projects can help set
    expectations. Get to know what other government texting initiatives have done as a way to benchmark your own
    performance.

  <h2>What other texting studies have found</h2>
  <p>
    When the <a
      href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/targeted-text-message-outreach-can-increase-wic-enrollment-pilots-show"
      target="_blank">Center
      on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> studied WIC, they found key learnings about the quantity of messages
    delivered, how people engage with messages, and how they take action.
  </p>
  <h3>Message delivery</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: <span class="text-bold">80%</span> of texts are successfully delivered
  </p>
  <p>
    You may discover that some numbers are temporarily or permanently unavailable due to service being discontinued,
    numbers changing, or being a landline.
  </p>

  <h3>Engagement</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: Engagement rates with texts ranged from <span
      class="text-bold">17%</span>
    to <span class="text-bold">26%</span></p>
  <p>
    The highest rate of engagement with a text comes within hours of sending. Engagement rates include any kind of
    action taken due to a text, including replying “STOP” to prevent future texts.
  </p>

  <h3>Appointment requests</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: Requesting appointments after receiving texts ranged from <span
      class="text-bold">4%</span> to <span class="text-bold">9%</span></p>
  <p>
    Requesting appointments is a specific type of engagement. Provide a phone number or link to an online appointment
    request form.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Code for America’s Texting Playbook reported specific learnings around appointment reminders, completing
    document submission, and maintenance reminders.
  </p>
  <h3>Appointment reminders</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: Clients were <span class="text-bold">79%</span> more likely to keep
    their appointment after receiving a text reminder.</p>
  <p>You will likely see more completed appointments.</p>

  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: Clients were <span class="text-bold">55%</span> more likely to complete
    an interview after receiving an interview reminder</p>
  <p>You will likely see more completed interviews.</p>

  <h3>Document submission</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">
    Benchmark: Clients were <span class="text-bold">6%</span> more likely to complete document submission after
    receiving a customized list of required documents via text
  </p>
  <p>To encourage response, provide a custom list of the needed documents and information about how to submit them. </p>

  <h3>Reminders</h3>
  <p class="font-body-lg text-light">Benchmark: Text reminders improved case maintenance rates by <span
      class="text-bold">21%</span></p>
  <p>You may see less turnover in your case rates.</p>
