  <h1>Text in multiple languages</h1>
  <p class="usa-intro text-base"> What to know as you plan translated texts.</p>

  <p>
    Sending messages in recipients’ preferred language demonstrates respect, makes it more likely that recipients will
    understand and take action on the message, and may be required by your agency or program.
  </p>

  <p>
    To send translated messages using Notify.gov you will need two things: a record of your recipients’ preferred
    language
    and translation/s of the message template. Notify.gov does not provide translation services.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with messages in English, we strongly recommend user testing the translations with people who speak the language
    to
    ensure the messages are understandable.
