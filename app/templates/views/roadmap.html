  <p>The Notify roadmap shows what we’re working on and what we're planning to do next.</p>
  <p>This roadmap is only a guide. It does not cover everything we do, and some things may change.</p>
  <p>You can <a class="usa-link" href="{{url_for('.support')}}">contact us</a> if you have any questions about the roadmap or suggestions for new features.</p>

  <h2 class="font-body-lg" id="things-we-are-working-on">What we’re working on</h2>

<h3 class="font-body-lg" id="now">Now</h3>

  <p>We are investigating the Notify concept, building on the notifications tool pioneered by the UK.</p>
  <p>To do this, we are convening a pilot with a small set of partners.</p>
  <p>Goals during this stage:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Achieve compliance to begin piloting, such as ATO and privacy standards</li>
    <li>Demonstrate that a government-run notifications tool provides a unique value</li>
    <li>Gather data from the pilot to improve the product</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Features prioritized during this stage:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Bulk, individually customizable one-way SMS sending via web UI</li>
    <li>Organization permissions settings for various team members to edit/send</li>
    <li>Reusable message templates</li>
    <li>Seven-day records deletion</li>
    <li>Message send/failure analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-body-lg" id="next">Next</h3>

  <p>If the pilot is successful, we hope to recruit additional high-impact partners to improve outcomes for low-income individuals and families.</p>

  <p>Goals during this stage:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Complement Notify with practical guidance and support services</li>
    <li>Iterate on existing features and implement new features based on what we've learned so far</li>
    <li>Hone our measurement approaches to better quantify impact</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Features prioritized during this stage:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>SMS sending via API integration</li>
    <li>Single-level decision two-way messaging (e.g. reply “YES” if, or “NO” if…)</li>
    <li>Self-service account creation</li>
    <li>Application status page</li>
    <li>Scheduled send option</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-body-lg" id="later">Later</h3>

  <p>In the future, we may decide to expand beyond SMS, or to offer the service government-wide.</p>

  <p>Features to be considered during this stage:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">

    <li>Email sending via UI and API</li>
    <li>Multiple-level decision two-way messaging (greater than one layer decision-tree)</li>
    <li>Open-text reply two-way messaging (rather than reply yes or no, 1 or 2, etc.)</li>
    <li>Multilingual interface and content library options</li>
    <li>Recurring scheduled send (such as “Send each Monday for 3 weeks”)</li>

  </ul>
