  <h1 class="font-body-2xl margin-bottom-3">Trial mode</h1>
  <p>When you add a new service it will start in trial mode. This lets you try out Notify.gov, with a few restrictions.</p>

  <h2 class="font-body-lg">Limits while in trial mode</h2>
  <p>While your service is in trial mode you can only:</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>send 50 text message parts per day</li>
    <li>send messages to yourself and other people in your team</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each text message is made up of one or more parts.</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Generally, 160 characters is one part (and one text message).</li>
    <li>A text message of 160-306 characters is two parts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information on how message parts are calculated, see
  <a href="/using-notify/pricing">Pricing</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="font-body-lg">Before going Live</h2>
  <p>Before you request to make your service live so you can send messages to clients:</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Add examples of the messages you want to send into Notify.</li>
    <li>Update your settings so youâ€™re ready to send and receive messages.</li>
    <li>Review your Terms of Use in the Memorandum of Understanding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-body-lg">Going Live</h3>
